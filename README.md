User-centric behaviour
- Input is selected - show input hint
- User enters their first attempt
- System checks validity on each key press, so we can put a validation tick next to the input if acceptable. No errors are visibly raised yet.
- When the input is finished ('change' event) then display if there's an error
- System checks validity on each key press, so we can put a validation tick next to the input if acceptable, or errors.
